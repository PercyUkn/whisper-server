# Host whisper model for free (AWS free tier)
Host whisper model on aws free tier EC2 instance step by step. 

We will use [Cython version](https://github.com/stlukey/whispercpp.py) of [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) so we could easily host it with fastapi.

In my case, I successfully host `tiny` and `base` on 1GB memory free tier EC2 ubuntu.  

# Step 1: Launch Ubuntu free EC2 instance on AWS
1. At AWS EC2 launch instance page, choose Ubuntu.

2. [optional] 
set up Key pair `.pem` file for SSH if you want to modify the code. Theoretically you don't need to SSH and modify code to make this project work. You can also directly use the console that AWS provided.

3. Network setting
For easy testing purpose, now we just allow traffic from everywhere.

4. Launch and connect your ubuntu instance
Launch the instance, and click connect button to the following page. You can use `EC2 Instance Connect` if you don't want to do SSH.

Now, your are connected to your EC2 Ubuntu instance!

# Step 2: Clone the Repo/Install Dependencies
Clone this Repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/hyqshr/whispercpp-fastapi.git
```
Go to project folder:
```
cd whispercpp-fastapi
```
Install dependencies (whisper require `ffmpeg`): 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install ffmpeg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 In my case, the system will prompt for reboot, just hit enter.

We are getting close. Now all the dependencies are installed

Now, run
```
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You should see something like this!

The `tiny` whisper model will be downloadded to `.cache`, it will only be downloadded once.

# Step 3: Nginx configuration
To enable other source to access our ubuntu instance, we need to configure Nginx.

```
sudo apt install nginx
```
By default, Nginx contains one server block called default. You can find it in this location: etc/nginx/sites-enabled.

Now at your root, run 
```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo vim fastapi_nginx
```

**Click i for insert mode**, then copy paste this in the file:

!!!Note, you should change your `server_name` to your Public IPv4 address.

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 3.87.220.60;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
}
```

To save and quit vim, hit `esc` on keyboard,then type `:wq!` one by one, then hit `enter`.

Start Nginx server:
```
sudo service nginx restart
```

Now, go to our project folder and start our server:
```
cd ~/whispercpp-fastapi
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Now visit you {public ipv4 address}/docs from your browser:

We are able to communicate to our API now! Try out the Swagger provided by fastapi, and try submit a file to our whisper worker

You should protect your endpoint with SSL/auth/some other configuration.
